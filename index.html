                    been ported to other platforms. The game consist of exploration, building, painting, combat and so much more...<br>

                    But how exactly did Terraria came to be... Well, fellow Terrarians, let us find out as we explore a brief history of the games creations.<br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    Prior to the 9th anniversary of Terraria, the studio would then release their "final" update, named...<br><br>
                    <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/1.4.0.1">
                    <img src = "journey-end-logo.webp" alt="Journey End Terraria" id="end-logo"><br><br>
                    </a>
                    Or simply called, the 1.4 Update. <br><br>
                    
                    Like with previous releases, it featured  new items, enemies, gameplay features. And two new difficulty modes.<br><br>


                    Ironically... despite the title, Terraria still continued to recieve updates, such as minor hotfixes and content updates. <br><br>such as the 

                    <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/1.4.2.3">10th anniversary patch</a>, <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/1.4.3">The Don't Starve Collaboration Update</a>,

                    - showing such passion <br><br>behind the ever-growing developers of Re-LOGIC. <br><br>
                    
                    Of course, the mobile and console were not left alone, as DR Studio have <br><br>ported the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Console_version_history">1.4</a>
                     version on October 20, 2020 for Mobile and IOS, and September 31, 2021
                    for Xbox 360, <br><br> Playstation 4, and PS4; and lastly, January 4, 2022 for Nintendo Switch. <br><br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    Until this day, Terraria is still being worked on by these passionate developers, with them still planning to release 1.4.5. <br>As the developers themselves have shown
                    some snippets and spoilers for the upcoming update on their twitter page<br><br>

                    Up to this day, Terraria has been recieved with favorable reviews from many critics, and up until 2022, <br>
                    has over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games">44,500,000 million copies</a> sold,
